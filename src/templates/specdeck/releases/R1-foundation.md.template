## Stories

<!-- Story Table Format:
Core columns (required):
- ID: Unique identifier (e.g., SDK-01-01) - serves as universal reference across all repos
- Title: Brief description of the story
- Status: planned | in_progress | in_review | blocked | done
- Complexity: XS | S | M | L | XL
- Owner: Person or team responsible

Optional columns (use as needed):
- Estimate: Story points or hours
- Jira: Jira ticket ID (for projects using Jira)
- OpenSpec: OpenSpec change ID (for projects using OpenSpec)
- Tags: Comma-separated tags
- Description: Detailed explanation

Multi-Repo Pattern:
- Main repo: Include all columns with Jira/OpenSpec links
- Other repos: Use same story IDs, omit external tool columns
- Story ID is the universal identifier across all repositories
-->
