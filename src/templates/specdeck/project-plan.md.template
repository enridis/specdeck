# Project Roadmap

This file provides a high-level overview of your project releases. Each release links to a detailed story file in the `releases/` directory.

**Two-Tier Planning Structure:**
- **This file (project-plan.md)**: High-level roadmap with release summaries, goals, and story counts
- **releases/R*.md**: Detailed story tables per release (editable story tracking)

SpecDeck commands auto-detect the active release (first with `status: in_progress`) and operate on it by default. Use `--release R1` to target a specific release or `--all` to operate across all releases.

## Managing Releases

**Commands:**
- `specdeck list stories` - Shows active release stories
- `specdeck list stories --release R1` - Shows specific release
- `specdeck list stories --all` - Shows all releases (including archived)
- `specdeck sync status` - Updates active release

**Archiving:**
When a release is complete, move its file to `releases/archive/` and update its status to `done`.
