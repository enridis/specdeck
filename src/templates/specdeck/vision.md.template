# Product Vision

This document defines the product vision for your project. It helps align the team on the problem being solved, the solution approach, and success metrics.

## Problem

<!-- Describe the core problem your project solves. Who experiences this problem? What pain points does it address? -->

*Example: Developers struggle with managing complex specifications and keeping them in sync with implementation. Existing tools are either too heavyweight (Jira, Azure DevOps) or too lightweight (markdown files without structure).*

## Solution

<!-- Explain your solution approach. What makes your solution unique or better? What are the key capabilities? -->

*Example: A lightweight CLI tool that combines the simplicity of markdown with structured specification management, enabling spec-driven development without heavy tooling overhead.*

## Target Users

<!-- Who is this project for? What are their key characteristics and needs? -->

*Example: Development teams (2-50 people) who value spec-driven development but want to avoid enterprise project management overhead. Teams already using Git and markdown for documentation.*

## Success Metrics

<!-- How will you measure success? What outcomes indicate the project is achieving its goals? -->

*Example:*
- *Adoption: 100+ active projects using the tool within 6 months*
- *Productivity: 30% reduction in spec/implementation drift*
- *Satisfaction: 4.5+ star rating on feedback surveys*

## Roadmap

<!-- High-level timeline showing major milestones and when you expect to achieve them -->

*Example:*
- *Q1 2025: Foundation (R1) - Core CLI and basic spec management*
- *Q2 2025: Advanced Features (R2) - Multi-repo support, CI/CD integration*
- *Q3 2025: Ecosystem (R3) - Plugins, IDE extensions, community templates*
